## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please send an email to security@symphonic.ai. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

## Security Measures

### API Authentication
- All API requests must include a valid API key in the `x-api-key` header
- API keys are validated on every request
- Different API key types with varying permission levels
- Automatic key rotation support

### Rate Limiting
- Per-endpoint rate limiting
- Per-API key rate limiting
- Configurable limits based on client tier
- Automatic blocking of excessive requests

### Input Validation
- All input is validated using Zod schemas
- Strict type checking
- Size limits on all inputs
- Sanitization of user-provided content

### Error Handling
- No sensitive information in error messages
- Structured error responses
- Detailed internal logging
- Error rate monitoring

### Network Security
- TLS 1.3 required for all connections
- HTTP security headers enforced
- CORS policies configured
- IP-based blocking available

### Monitoring
- Real-time security event monitoring
- Automated alerts for suspicious activity
- Regular security audits
- Usage pattern analysis

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data logged
- Secure credential storage
- Regular data cleanup
- Access logging

## Best Practices for Users

1. **API Keys**
   - Keep API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code
   - Use different API keys for development and production
   - Rotate API keys regularly
   - Set appropriate permissions for each key

2. **Rate Limits**
   - Implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Cache responses when possible
   - Monitor your usage
   - Contact support if you need higher limits

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error handling in your code
   - Monitor for error patterns
   - Report any security-related errors
   - Keep your client libraries updated

4. **Data Security**
   - Minimize sensitive data in requests
   - Implement proper data sanitization
   - Use secure communication channels
   - Regular security audits of your implementation
